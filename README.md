### Hello there! 

🇦🇺 I am Kadison McLellan. I am an Australian high school student who aspires to be a software developer.

✏️ My biggest goal is to better my everyday life and productivity. Many of my projects are aimed towards improving quality of life for myself and others.

🎮 I am a very big VR enthusiast. I've loved sci-fi and dystopian concepts ever since I was a child.

If my status is set to busy it means I'm in the middle of a school term, so bear with me.
